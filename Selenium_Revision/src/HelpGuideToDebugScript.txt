In order to debug any piece of code/script we follow these following steps:
1. Add the breakpoint at any particular line number (The code before that line is assumed to be passed)
2. In order to execute from that particular we do "Step Over"
3. In order to make the script in normal fashion, we do "Resume"
4. In order to execute the function in debugging mode, we do "Step In"
